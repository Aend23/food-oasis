# Food Oasis Developers

This page talks about how to contribute to the project as a developer. We have developers working on Windows, IOS and Linux platforms, so we will attempt to provide instrutions for developers work on any of these operating systems.

### Pre-requisites

We assume you are familiar with Github and have node and npm installed on your machine. We generally stick with the current long term stable (LTS) version of node, so that is your best option for minimizing node version issues.

We also assume you are using Microsoft VS Code as your code editor, though you are free to use any editor you are comfortable with, but may need to adapt some instructions here for your editor of choice.
